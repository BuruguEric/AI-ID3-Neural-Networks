# Machine Learning Coding Assignments :sunglasses:

## Decision Trees
The model is used to determine whether a car is fast or not based on provided attributes.

Inside ```ID3algo/``` you will find:
 - Training dataset ```classes/id3_data.csv```
 - The model ```classes/id3.py```
 - The networkx class to draw the output ```classes/networkx.py```
 - The class to be run in order to see the output ```code.py```

 ## Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
 The model code is in ```main.py``` and ```neural_network.py```. The dataset is defined in ``main.py``. The file will output the final matrix weights of each layer.
